        question: 'Is the PKloop app free to use?',
        answer: `YES. PKLoop is 100% Free to access. Travelers list your trips for FREE, Cargo and Container Shipping Companies or Individuals can advertise and List your container shipment dates for FREE!

        question:
          'Why Use PKLoop as opposed to Traditional Shipping companies?',
        answer: `Traditional Same-day and Express shipping options tend to be outrageously costly. Our app compares prices across the board, displays available cost options (you can also compare pricing using attached chart). PKLoop travelers save you at least 50% in shipping fees. ($14.99 to send a 1 lb package to Canada using PKLoop vs $65 using 2-Day Express Shipping)
        Using a PKLoop traveler means faster custom clearance (minutes or hours) as opposed to days or even weeks.`

        question: 'Is PKLoop legal?',
        answer: `YES. Anyone over the age of 18 can use the PKLoop Site as Sender, traveler, or recipient. You simply carry the item as you would do for a family member or a friend.`
