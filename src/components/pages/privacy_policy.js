            and mobile application is referred to in this privacy policy as a
            “Site”.

            In order to operate the PKLoop Site and to provide You with
            information about products or services that may be of interest to
            You, We may collect “personal information” (i.e. information that
            could be used to contact You directly (without using the PKLoop
            Site) such as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit
            card information, or email address) or “demographic information”
